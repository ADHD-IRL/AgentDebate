              Every AI step in AgentDebate is driven by a prompt. This library shows each one in the order the workflow uses them — what triggers it, the template (with <span className="font-mono">{'{placeholders}'}</span> for runtime values), and what the output becomes. It mirrors the live templates in <span className="font-mono">src/lib/llm.js</span>; those remain the source of truth.
