    title: 'What is AgentDebate?',
    content: `
AgentDebate is a **structured red-teaming platform** — a systematic way to stress-test plans, strategies, or decisions by simulating how adversaries, disruptors, or unexpected forces might exploit weaknesses.

Think of it like a **chess grandmaster reviewing a game before it's played**. Instead of reacting to problems after they happen, AgentDebate assembles a panel of expert "thinking styles" — called Agents — and forces them to imagine every way things could go wrong, from every angle simultaneously.

The core insight: **no single expert sees everything**. A cybersecurity specialist thinks differently than an economist, who thinks differently than a geopolitical analyst. AgentDebate structures a conversation between these perspectives so blind spots become visible before they become crises.

**What AgentDebate is NOT:**
- It's not a chatbot. It's a structured analytical framework.
- It's not a prediction engine. It surfaces risk — it doesn't forecast futures.
- It's not a replacement for human judgment. It's a tool to sharpen it.

The sidebar is organized as the workflow, top to bottom. Follow it in order and each step feeds the next:

**1 · Build** — Set up your reusable assets: **Domains** (broad categories), **Agents** (your expert panel), and the **SME Library** (curate and reuse experts). These persist across every session.

**2 · Plan** — Define the specific engagement: a **Scenario** (the situation to stress-test) and, optionally, a **Threats** catalog (known risks). Tag both with domains.

**3 · Run** — Bring a scenario and agents together in a **Session** (structured two-round analysis) or the **What-If Simulator**. This is where the red-teaming happens.

**4 · Act on Findings** — Work the output: the **Threat Map** (coverage gaps), **Chains** (kill chains), **Chain Breaker** (mitigation roadmaps), and **Reports** (executive PDFs).

**Insights** — **Agent Analytics** and **Compare** for cross-session trends. **System** holds Settings and this guide.

**New here?** The **Dashboard** shows a getting-started checklist that tracks these steps and always points to your next action. It disappears once you've run your first session.

They keep everything organized and color-coded, and they are the **connective tissue of the platform**: the Threat Map, coverage analysis, and agent filtering all link threats to agents through their shared domain.

**Set these up first.** Everything else (agents, scenarios, threats) can be tagged to a domain — and an untagged threat or agent is invisible to the Threat Map's coverage analysis.

**Keep domains broad.** Aim for 10–15 wide buckets ("Critical Infrastructure & Industrial Resilience") rather than one domain per specialty. Broad domains let you group many agents and threats together, which is what makes the map and coverage views readable.

**Sync from Agents.** If your agents have disciplines but no domains, the "Sync from Agents" button on the Domains page derives domain candidates from agent disciplines. A **preview popup** shows every domain that would be created — with a checkbox per domain and the number of agents it would receive — before anything is written to the database. Uncheck any junk candidates, then confirm. Nothing is saved until you do.`

The analogy: imagine hiring a panel of consultants for a day. One is a former counterintelligence officer. One is a supply chain economist. One is a futurist. Each one looks at the same situation through a completely different lens. An Agent in AgentDebate captures that lens.

Each Agent has:
- **Discipline** — their professional identity (e.g., "HUMINT Officer," "Critical Infrastructure Engineer")
- **Domain** — the broad category they belong to (links them to threats on the Threat Map)
- **Persona Description** — who they are and how they think
- **Cognitive Bias** — what they systematically over- or under-weight (this is deliberate — biases create diversity of view)
- **Red Team Focus** — what specific threats they're hunting for
- **Vector Weights** — how much they emphasize Human, Technical, Physical, and Futures dimensions (0–100 each)
- **Default Severity** — their baseline risk posture (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW). This is the colored pill on the agent card. It is NOT a rating of the agent — it describes how alarmed this persona tends to be, and it is used as their fallback severity in debate rounds if a response doesn't declare one. Hover the pill for a full explanation.
- **Extended persona fields** — epistemic style, institutional background, conflict triggers, decision style, adversary model, institutional incentives, and analytical framework. These are injected into the debate prompts, so the richer they are, the more distinct and realistic each agent's voice becomes.

You can build agents manually, generate them with AI, or import batches from a formatted Markdown file. You can also **create a new agent directly inside the session builder** using the "+ New Agent" button — it saves to your agent library and is immediately selected for the session.`

Threats live in the library and can be tagged, categorized, and linked to scenarios. They can also be AI-generated from a scenario context document. Threats are the *what* — Agents assess the *how bad* and *why it matters*.

**Give every threat a Domain and a Category.** The Domain links it to the agents who can analyze it (this powers the Threat Map and coverage analysis); the Category groups it with similar threats (these become the heatmap columns). A threat without a domain shows up in the map's "Unassigned" row until you assign one.`

The analogy: a Chain is like a **kill chain or attack tree**, but written in plain language. "Step 1: An insider with finance access exfiltrates procurement data. Step 2: A competitor uses that data to undercut bids. Step 3: Revenue erosion triggers a workforce reduction. Step 4: Key technical staff leave, creating a capability gap."

Each step can be attributed to an Agent or labeled freely. Chains can be built manually or AI-generated from a scenario.

**Chains are automatically extracted from synthesis.** When you generate a synthesis report, AgentDebate parses out any compound threat chains identified by the AI and saves them directly to your chain library — tagged to that session and scenario. You don't need to do anything manually.

**Chains are now generated as true kill chains.** Each step is an adversary action with an explicit "enabled by" precondition tied to the previous step, so the chain reads as a dependency sequence a defender can attack: break any one step and the chain stops. Feed a chain into the **Chain Breaker** (next section) to turn it into a prioritized mitigation plan.`

4. The model responds in character — a structured assessment with findings, assumptions, inline source citations, a severity rating, and a **calibrated confidence score (0–100)**
5. The assessment, severity, and confidence are saved; status updates to "r1_done"
6. When the last agent completes manually (without using Generate All), the session status auto-advances to "round1"

Agents do NOT see each other's assessments in Round 1. This ensures independent thinking before cross-pollination.

**Two things each Round 1 assessment now includes by design:**
- **A cross-domain handoff** — every agent must name the OTHER discipline whose interaction with their findings worries them most and pose a direct question to that expert. This plants the hooks that Round 2 turns into compound risks.

- **Leverage** — how much breaking this step sets back the whole chain
- **Chokepoint** — flagged when the adversary has no realistic alternate path; cutting a chokepoint collapses the chain

- The **roadmap** is a deduplicated, priority-ordered action plan.

        body: `The **Threat Concentration Heatmap** is a grid of your risk landscape:
- **Rows** = domains (or disciplines, per the toggle)
- **Columns** = threat categories, with a total count under each header
- **Cell color** = the highest severity present at that intersection (red CRITICAL → amber HIGH → blue MEDIUM → green LOW)
- **Cell intensity** = volume — the darker the cell, the more threats concentrated there

Rows with zero mapped threats are hidden by default so the map stays dense and readable; a **"show N empty rows"** checkbox in the legend reveals them (useful for spotting domains you've staffed but never mapped threats to).

**Hover** any cell for a breakdown of its threats by severity with full titles. **Click** any cell (or a row name, or a row total) to open the **drill-down panel**.`,
        usage: `
1. Navigate to **Threat Map** from the sidebar — the heatmap is the default view.
2. Scan for dark red cells first: that's where critical threats concentrate.
3. Hover a cell to preview its threats; click it to open the drill-down panel.
4. Check the "Unassigned" row at the bottom — threats there need a domain before they can be analyzed for coverage.
5. Toggle GROUP BY to Discipline to see which specific specialty within a hot domain is carrying the load.

The radar shows the top 12 groups; a ranked list alongside it shows everything, each row with its severity mix bar and agent count. Use it to see, in one shape, which parts of your risk landscape dominate.

**Severity Breakdown** gives you three layers:
- **Summary cards** — total threats at each severity level with percentages
- **Stacked bars per group** — each row's threat load split by severity, sorted by exposure score
- **Group × Category matrix** — a compact grid of colored dots showing the highest severity at each intersection; empty dark cells are intersections with no recorded threats

All rows and matrix cells are clickable — everything opens the same drill-down panel as the heatmap.`

        body: `The coverage panel at the bottom of every view is the **actionable core of the Threat Map**. For each domain it compares the **threat load** (the weighted exposure score) against the **agent bench** (how many agents cover that domain), and sorts the results into:

- **COVERAGE GAPS** (red) — domains with real threat load but **zero or one agent**. Your panel cannot credibly analyze these. Each gap row has a **⚡SME button** that jumps straight to the Agents page with the AI-generate modal already open and pre-seeded with the domain — see a gap, close a gap in two clicks.
- **STRETCHED BENCH** (amber) — domains carrying critical or heavy load with below-median staffing. Not empty, but thin.
- **COVERED** (green) — threat areas with a healthy bench.
- **IDLE BENCH** — domains where you have agents but zero mapped threats. Either genuinely low-risk, or a sign you haven't catalogued that area's threats yet.

Click any row to open the drill-down panel for that domain.`,
        usage: `
1. Scroll to the bottom of any Threat Map view — the coverage panel is always visible.
2. Start with COVERAGE GAPS: these are threats nobody on your panel can speak to.
3. Click ⚡SME on a gap to generate a matching expert — the AI modal opens pre-filled with the domain and a suggested expert type.
4. Review STRETCHED BENCH next: consider generating or cloning a second agent for domains carrying critical load alone.
5. Treat IDLE BENCH as a prompt: run AI threat generation for those domains, or accept them as low-priority.

A slice with threats but no agents is flagged in red as a coverage gap.

**Category merge nudge.** Threat categories are free text, so near-duplicates creep in ("Cyber" vs "Cybers") and fragment the heatmap columns. When the map detects similar category names, a blue banner appears offering a one-click **Merge** — it rewrites the category on the affected threats to the most common variant. You confirm before anything changes.

**Unassigned threats banner.** If any threats lack a domain, an amber banner reports the count with an "Open Threats" button. Assign domains there and the map recalculates immediately.`

It has seven tabs:
- **Overview** — KPI tiles (total SMEs, average quality score, high-quality count, unscored count) plus quality-distribution and top-by-usage charts
- **Library** — the curated, shared SME collection: sortable, searchable, with inline Promote / Clone / Archive / Delete actions
- **Workspace** — the same table scoped to your own workspace's SMEs, with a Promote-to-Library action for your best profiles
- **Generate** — describe a scenario and AI-generate a panel of matching SME profiles, then promote the keepers
- **Quality** — a quality monitor: score distribution, low-scoring profiles that need enrichment, and unscored profiles
- **Tokens** — create and revoke API tokens for programmatic access to your SME collection (the token is shown once at creation — copy it immediately)
- **Import/Export** — export your collection as JSON or CSV, and import SMEs from a JSON file with a preview step

**Library vs Workspace:** library SMEs are the curated, shared collection; workspace SMEs are your private working set. Clone a library SME into your workspace to customize it without touching the shared version; promote a polished workspace SME into the library to share it.`

**A practical curation loop:**
1. Import or generate SMEs in bulk
2. Check the **Quality tab** — profiles scoring low usually have empty extended fields
3. Open a low scorer, use the per-field AI regenerate buttons to enrich it
4. Promote your best profiles to the library so every scenario can draw on them
5. Archive (don't delete) SMEs you're not using — archiving is reversible

        title: 'Interpret severity disagreements as signals',
        body: 'When one agent rates a threat CRITICAL and another rates it LOW, that isn\'t noise — it\'s signal. It means the threat\'s impact is highly dependent on which domain lens you apply. Explore those gaps, not just the consensus.'

        title: 'Check the evidence ledger before presenting',
        body: 'Open the SOURCES tab (By SME view) after a session. The evidence-quality score and the Unsupported Assessments callout tell you which experts argued from real evidence and which relied on persona reasoning alone. Then run Validity Analysis to catch inter-agent contradictions. A CRITICAL finding at 40% confidence with no cited sources deserves far more scrutiny than a HIGH backed by authoritative citations.'
